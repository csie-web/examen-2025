## Task Status Operations

### Clarifications

- Add a new entity `TaskStatus`. `TaskStatus` is an entity that has an `id`, `label`, `description`, and `enabled`. The `id` is numeric and serves as the primary key. `label` and `description` are string fields with a maximum length of 255 characters. `enabled` is a boolean used for the soft delete mechanism.
- Add functionality to create, edit, and delete a `TaskStatus`.
- Deleting a `TaskStatus` should be a soft delete (logical deletion). This means changing the `TaskStatus` from enabled to disabled. A `TaskStatus` that is not enabled cannot be used.
- The interface for adding a `TaskStatus` should be accessible from the `TaskStatus` list.
- Navigation routes to the `TaskStatus` list and the `TaskStatus` creation page must be protected (i.e., inaccessible to unauthenticated users).

### Detailed Scoring
