## User Management Operations

### Clarifications

- Add an administration interface for the `User` entity. This interface should be accessible only to users with the `admin` role.
- Add functionality to create, edit, and delete a `User`.
- User deletion should be a soft delete (logical deletion). This means changing a userâ€™s status from enabled to disabled. A user who is not enabled cannot authenticate.
- A user has an `enabled` field, which defaults to `true`. When a user is deleted, this field should be set to `false`.
- When editing a user, the `password` field can be left unchanged, in which case the password remains unaffected.
- The interface for adding a `User` should be accessible from the `User` list.
- Navigation routes to the `User` list and the `User` creation page must be protected (i.e., inaccessible to unauthenticated users).
